# Public Transportation

When you use public transporation, such as buses and trains in Japan, I highly recommend to use "Pasmo", prepaid and rechargebale contactless smar cards, which can also be installable on Android smartphones or iPhones.
Because Tokyo's transporation system is run by several companies, it is so complex; buying tickets every time at the machine is not a good idea.
Instead, if you prepare Pasmo once, you can ride almost all buses and tranins in Tokyo or other big cities.

Installation is easy.
On iPhone, open the Wallet app, tap the plus button at the top right corner, select "Transit Card", select "Pasmo", and then follow the instruction!
On Android, use the Google Pay app.
That's it!
